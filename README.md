# FAQ Accordion

This is my solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). 

## Overview

- I worked on a responsive FAQ accordion component as a solution to challenge on Frontend Mentor.
- The challenge required specific functionalities, such as toggling answers, and responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Encountering issues with the toggle functionality during the challenge prompted me to conduct in-depth research to address the effectiveness of the toggle option. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into debugging and troubleshooting, enhancing my problem-solving skills. This experience reinforced the importance of comprehensive research and experimentation to overcome challenges in coding projects.

### Continued development
- Accessibility Practices:
Explore and implement advanced accessibility practices to ensure my FAQ accordion is inclusive and usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
- JavaScript Frameworks:
I consider learning and incorporating JavaScript frameworks such as React or Vue.js to build more scalable and maintainable components.
- Responsive Design Refinement:
I choose to refine my skills in responsive design, exploring advanced techniques like mobile-first development and handling complex layout scenarios.
-Testing and Debugging:
Strengthen my debugging skills, by utilizing browser developer tools for efficient debugging.
-Browser Compatibility:
Explore techniques to ensure cross-browser compatibility, addressing potential issues that may arise on different web browsers.
